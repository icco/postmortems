Use of different units of measurement (metric vs. English) caused Mars Climate Orbiter to fail. There were also organisational and procedural failures[[ref](http://space.stackexchange.com/a/20241)] and defects in the navigation software[[ref](http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/robotic-exploration/why-the-mars-probe-went-off-course)].
